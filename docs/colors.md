# ðŸŽ¨ Colors

All of Compound's color tokens are generated from a handful of *key colors* using a script based on Leonardo Color by Adobe. This repository includes a web applet which can be used to visualize the generated color palette and experiment with custom key colors. To launch it, run:

```
yarn dev:colors
```

Additionally when built, the design tokens package provides a set of JS utilities for generating color scales from custom key colors on the fly in apps, just like those seen in the web applet. (TODO: usage details)
